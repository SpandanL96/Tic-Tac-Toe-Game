# Tic-Tac-Toe

A classic two-player game implemented in [language/technology used, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript]. The game allows Player 1 and Player 2 to compete against each other with symbols X and O, respectively. The game also accounts for scenarios where no player wins, leading to a draw.

4. Interactive interface: The game board is responsive and visually appealing, providing a user-friendly experience.

    Players take turns to place their symbol on an empty cell.
3. Winning: A player wins if they align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
